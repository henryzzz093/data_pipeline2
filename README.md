<!-- About The Project -->
## About The Project
![](images/Airflow.png)

The goal for this project is to demnostrate the process of ETL automation using **Airflow**, **Docker Containers** and **Python**. 


## Built With
Some major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap this project:
* [Apache-airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
* [Mysql-connector-python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)
* [Psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
#### Docker
Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your computer. If you do not have Docker installed please use this link to [download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):

Once Docker is installed, make sure it is up and running in your background.

Verify that the minimum memory requirements for Docker are set. Use the image below as a reference:

#### Make

Make sure your Makefile is version `4.3` or higher. You can check your current version by typing the following in terminal:\
`make --version`
```bash
make --version
GNU Make 4.3
Copyright (C) 1988-2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```
To upgrade `make` use the following command:
```bash
brew install make
```
Add "gnubin" directory to your PATH in the terminal once the upgrade is complete :
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```


### Running the Application

1. Use the following command to run the application:
```bash
make run-app
```

2. Check that the application is running by going to your [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

(Please note that application can take anywhere between 1 - 5 minutes to run depending on your particular system)

3. Login to the Airflow Webserver using the following credentials:
   - username: `airflow` 
   - password:`airflow`

4. Trigger the DAGs to ensure that they are working properly. 

5. Check the **How To** section for additional instructions.

6. Shut down the application by entering the following command in your terminal:<br>
` make reset`


<!-- How To -->
## How To

### 1. How to verify the Airflow is running
```bash
docker ps
```
![](images/docker_ps.png)

### 2. How to verify the MySQL table is created
```bash
docker exec -it ms_container bash
```
and then connected to the MySQL inside the container by using the following:
- host = host.docker.internal
- port = 3307
- user = henry
- passcode = henry
- table name = stocks

![](images/inside_MySQL.png)
here we can see before tirggering the MySQL dag, the table is empty.

After triggering the dag:

## 3. How to verify the Postgres table is created
```bash
docker exec -it pg_container bash
```
and then connected to the MySQL inside the container by using the following:
- host = host.docker.internal
- port = 5438
- user = henry
- passcode = henry
- table name = stocks

![](images/inside_Postgres.png)

here we can see before tirggering the Postgres dag, the table is empty.
